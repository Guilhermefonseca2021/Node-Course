## Engine V8

the browser have a engine to run javascript versions on navigator, the node use the same system to create api with javascript. it's a run time language to communicate with the engine v8 in a phone or anywhere outside of the browser with a lot of components.

## NodeJS vs Javascript

- in browser we have window, document, history, location, navigator
- in node.js we have instead
global as window,
proccess as document,
history as module,
__filename as location,
require as navigator

## Backend vs Frontend

the backend is what happens in the system that is being hiding from the user. Frontend we show informations, google is a server with pages frontend, but the data from the every search adn response is from the backend the part of security.
